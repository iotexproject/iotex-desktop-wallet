## Web Socket Integration

ioPay wallet will serve web socket at 64102 during the Application initialization.

When the user opens the DApp [integrated with iotex-antenna WsSignerPlugin](https://docs.iotex.io/docs/libraries-and-tools.html#working-with-desktop-wallet), our antenna SDK will connect to the wallet to get the address and send envelops.
